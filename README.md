# menios_pong

This project is designed to help a friend learn C++. It is not intended to be practical.

# Tasks

- Display some arbitrary 2D functions
- Implement a simple [pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game with keyboard and/or mouse controls.

To implement the above tasks the SDL2 and OpenGL environment is already setup. One can display a different image every frame. For start, It just repeatedly changes one pixel from black to white at a time at a predefined position.
The runtime runs on Linux, Windows and Web Browsers (through emscripten). Mac is not tested but should work.
